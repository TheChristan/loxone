NOTE! In the video he already has a preset for A0, but this wasn't for me included in Affinity Designer 2. So you need to create one for yourself. You can do this by creating a new file, then in the pop-up screen create your own preset on the bottom left. Use for Page width 841mm and for Page height 1189mm. If you got any questions about this, just ask :).

Steps:
1. Install and setup Affinity Designer 2. You can do this free, with a trial. Just follow the instructions on the internet. When using the trial you DO NOT have a watermark but after the 30-trial ends you need to make a one time payment to keep using it.
2. Add the pack to you assets. You can do this by following these steps:
    1. In the Designer Persona or Pixel Persona, select the Assets panel.
    2. From the Panel Preferences menu, select Import Assets.
    3. Browse to and select the .afassets file you want to import.
    4. Click Open.
3. Create new file.
3. Now you can start using it!

NOTE! Make sure that you have selected the right assets in the Asset screen on the left of Affinity Designer 2
